**Comment:** 
Final version of the L1 menu for the 2024 HeavyIons collisions.
This menu has been created by using the last version of TME `0.17.1`, grammar `0.13` and updated scales to `scales_2023_02_16`.
The menu development for the Heavy Ions runs is documented in [CMSLITDPG-1314](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-1314).

<br/>

The following changes, from the last HI menu (`L1Menu_CollisionsHeavyIons2024_v1_0_2`), have been made:

   - Used the “TOWERCOUNT” object instead of “ASYMETHF” for the rapidity-gap seeds. The name of the seeds is unchanged.
      - `L1_ZDC1n_OR_OneSideGap_BptxAND`
      - `L1_SingleUncorrJet2/4/6/8/12/16/20/24/28_ZDC1n_OR_OneSideRapGap_BptxAND`
